# What did you do this past week?
My roommates and I accepted internships for the summer! Now that I can stop thinking about interviews and internships, I can finally relax and focus on my classes for the rest of the semester. To celebrate, we had a scary movie night where we watched the Conjuring with a few friends. This Saturday, we also went to Snow's BBQ for lunch. It's been rated as the #1 barbecue in Texas, and it's definitely my favorite out of all the ones I've tried so far.

# What's in your way?
My graduation plans have changed a bit since last year, so I'm trying to figure out my remaining semesters. I might have to Q-drop a class so I'll have to speak to my advisor next week.

# What will you do next week?
IDB is basically the only thing I have to work on. I don't have exams for a while so there's nothing major to study for in the near future. I'm also trying to learn OCaml so I'll spend a fair chunk of my time on that.

# What's my experience of the class?
I'm used to the flow of the class by now. One thing I don't like are the daily quizzes, especially since I had to miss a few when I was away for interviews. It seems unfair that a class whose goal is to make us ready for internships penalizes students who interview for them.

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
[MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) is a tool to manage MySQL databases. It lets you execute SQL queries and see how they are executed, visualize schemas, and import/export data from a database. I've used it extensively for IDB since it provides a nice interface to interact with our data.
