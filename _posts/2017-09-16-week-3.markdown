# What did you do this past week?
I spent most of Wednesday finishing up Collatz and worked on assignments for my other classes the rest of the week. Career fair finally came around, but I didn't really want to go --- so instead I stayed home and binged TV shows. I also had my first phone interview of the semester. I took it at my friend's apartment since I get better reception there, but I forgot my own keys and got locked out of my apartment. I didn't bother changing since this was right after I got out of bed, so I had to wait in the hallway in my PJs for 20 minutes until my roommate saved me. As always, this week was filled with almost daily coffee trips, and even a visit to Austin Pets Alive to pet kittens. This semester is definitely off to a good start.

# What's in your way?
Not much right now. All of my classes are going smoothly and I'm excited to fly out to onsites so I can spend a weekend in some other city.

# What will you do next week?
Probably more interviews and more assignments. I might try to cook more at home instead of just relying on frozen dumplings and rice.

# What's my experience of the class?
This past week of class has not been very engaging since we are just going details of Python. It seems like this material would be better covered in the 1-hour Python language class.

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
[LMGTFY](https://lmgtfy.com/) is a website that lets you show people how to use Google to find information on the internet. This site is great for when your friend asks you "How do I add 2 numbers in Python?".
